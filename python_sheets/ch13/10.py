'''
10. Write a function called closest that takes a list of numbers L and a number n and returns
    the largest element in L that is not larger than n. For instance, if L=[1,6,3,9,11] and n=8,
    then the function should return 6, because 6 is the closest thing in L to 8  that is not larger
    than 8. Donâ€™t worry about if all of the things in L are smaller than n.

'''

def closest(L: list, n):

    L.sort()
    largest_num = 0

    for i in range(len(L)):

        if(L[i] < n):

            largest_num = L[i]

        if(L[i] > n):
            break

    return largest_num


print(closest([1, 6, 3, 9, 11], 8))
